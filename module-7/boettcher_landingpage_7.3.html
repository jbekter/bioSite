                <p class = "p1">Cecilia was born in Lagos, Nigeria but moved to Atlanta, Georgia when she was two years old.  
                    She has also lived in South Dakota, Nebraska, South Korea, and Chile.  
                    It’s no coincidence that Cecilia’s favorite hobbies are traveling and trying foods from different cultures. 
                </p>  
                <p class = "p2">
                    Out of all the places Cecilia has visited, London England was her favorite travel destination.  
                    She particularly enjoyed the food, walkability, and public transportation because she can find something to do within walking distance or by taking a short trip on the tube. 
                    It also doesn’t hurt that she found a restaurant near her hotel that served her favorite English breakfast, bangers and mash.
                </p> 
                <p class = "p3">
                    Although bangers and mash are near the top of Cecilia’s list of breakfast foods, her favorite food is a Korean soup called Naengmyeon. 
                    Naengmyeon is served cold, but it is packed with flavor.  
                    Some of the main ingredients include a cold beef broth, noodles, brisket, scallions, and radishes.  
                    Cecilia is looking forward to eating this again soon during her next travel destination when she visits her friend in Seoul, South Korea.
                </p>
                <p class = "p4">
                    When Cecilia isn’t busy traveling or trying new foods, she is busy pushing herself to learn new things.  
                    Cecilia is a lifelong learner, obtaining a bachelor's degree in international management from Gustavus Adolphus, a master’s degree in accounting from Liberty University, and most recently, a bachelor's degree in computer science from South Dakota State University.
                </p>
                <p class = "p5">    
                    Cecilia’s career began as Multicultural Recruitment Coordinator after earning her degree in international management.  
                    She enjoyed that role because it allowed her to travel but she always wanted to live abroad so she decided to take a leap of faith and move to Korea to become an English teacher.  
                    Although she loved this experience, her contract had ended so she decided to pursue new opportunities, so she began pursuing her degree in computer science. 
                </p>
                <p class = "p6"> 
                    Cecilia began working as a Manual QA tester at Hayneedle, an e-commerce furniture company, but set her sights on learning QA automation.  One of her proudest work accomplishments is working her way into her current role as a Software Development Engineer in Test at FiveSixTwo within 2 years.  Cecilia’s next goal is working towards becoming a Software Engineer after completing some additional schooling.
